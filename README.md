Crayon-Draw
===========

Crayon Draw: Is a basic drawing app designed for kids, that allows them to draw pictures using a simulated crayon.

This project is coded in an older version of android studio, hence I can't ensure you the compiling instructions I am about
to give are a 100% accurate.

Compile Instructions:
Create a new project in android studio (Name it whatever you want)
Copy all files from the src folder into the src folder of your app.
Update all package references to the proper package.
Update your manifest file as needed to point to MainActivity.java as the entry point for the app.
Download the google gson lib.
Create a folder named libs under the app folder in android studio.
Copy the gson library to the libs folder you just created.
